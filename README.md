# d3.js-budget-ville
Datavisualisation du budget de la Ville de Lanester

Trying to develop a kind of "open data culture" inside our structure, we decided to propose a use of some dataset. This is how we meet d3.js in order to make a datavizualization of our budget.

We are not masters in javscript, so our production is kind of a hack. So if anyone can help improve what we did, we would be grateful.
